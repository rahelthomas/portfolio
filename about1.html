<p›Hello,I'm Rahel Abraham Thomas. I am passionate about</p> 
</div>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Music</h2>
<p>I really love music, especially singing and playing the piano. When I sit at the piano, it's like I'm painting emotions with the keys, and singing adds a personal touch to the music. Whether I'm playing classical pieces or singing modern songs, it brings me so much joy and allows me to express myself in a way that words can't. Music isn't just a hobby for me; it's a journey where I discover new emotions and express myself in a way that feels truly genuine.</p><br>
<p>I have completed till ABRSM Grade 5 Vocal Exam and ABRSM Grade 1 Piano Exam. I have also completed till ABRSM Grade 5 in Theory in Music.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">Art</h2>
<p>Sketching with pencils is my go-to, but I'm always eager to try out new art stuff. There's something magical about the way a pencil glides across the paper, bringing my ideas to life with each stroke. But then, there's the thrill of experimenting with different mediums. It's like stepping into a whole new world of colors and textures, where every stroke tells a different story. It's all about exploring, learning, and seeing where my creativity takes me.</p>
